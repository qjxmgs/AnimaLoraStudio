# Getting Started

Run a LoRA training pipeline end to end. This is the full version of the [README](../../README.en.md) "Quick start".

## Prerequisites

These are **not** installed by Studio and must be ready beforehand:

- **NVIDIA GPU driver + CUDA runtime** (16 GB+ VRAM recommended, 8 GB barely works; AMD GPUs / Apple Silicon are not supported)
- **Python 3.10+** (callable as `python` from PATH)
- **Node.js 18+** (for frontend build, with `npm` on PATH)
- **Git**

Hardware details: see [README → Hardware requirements](../../README.en.md#hardware-requirements).

## Start Studio

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WalkingMeatAxolotl/AnimaLoraStudio
cd AnimaLoraStudio

# Windows
studio.bat

# Linux / macOS
./studio.sh
```

On first run, the launcher automatically: creates `venv/` → installs the matching CUDA torch (cu118 through cu130) based on the detected GPU driver → installs `requirements.txt` → builds the frontend → starts the backend → opens the browser to <http://127.0.0.1:8765/>. A first-run onboarding modal then walks through installing base models, ONNX Runtime, and training acceleration with one click.

> If GPU detection falls back to CPU torch, reinstall the CUDA build from Settings → System → PyTorch with one click, or specify it explicitly via `studio.bat --torch cu128` (or `studio.sh --torch cu128`).

### Alternative launch

Equivalent to the above, useful when calling `python` directly:

```bash
python -m studio              # Build frontend if missing, then start backend
python -m studio dev          # Watch mode: vite 5173 + uvicorn 8765 --reload
python -m studio build        # Build frontend only
python -m studio test         # pytest + vitest
```

## Upgrading an existing installation

Read [Upgrading to v0.27](upgrading-v0.27.en.md) first: stop jobs and back up data before updating dependencies. First startup automatically separates legacy settings and LLM preset storage.

## Download models

After launch, go to the model download center under **Settings → Training**. Downloads are grouped by model family (Anima / Krea 2) — grab only the family you plan to train (defaults to `./models/`); Anima-only users can skip the large Krea 2 files:

| Item | Source | Path | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anima base model (latest = 1.0) | [circlestone-labs/Anima](https://huggingface.co/circlestone-labs/Anima) | `models/diffusion_models/` | ~4 GB |
| Qwen-Image VAE (shared by Anima / Krea 2) | Same | `models/vae/` | ~250 MB |
| Qwen3-0.6B-Base text encoder | [Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-Base](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-Base) | `models/text_encoders/` | ~1.2 GB |
| T5 tokenizer (3 files only, no weights) | [google/t5-v1_1-xxl](https://huggingface.co/google/t5-v1_1-xxl) | `models/t5_tokenizer/` | <1 MB |
| Krea 2 Raw (LoRA training / samples during training) | [krea/Krea-2-Raw](https://huggingface.co/krea/Krea-2-Raw) | `models/diffusion_models/krea2-raw-bf16.safetensors` | ~26.3 GB |
| Krea 2 Raw **official fp8** (training / inference on 24 GB-class GPUs) | [Comfy-Org/Krea-2](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Krea-2) | `models/diffusion_models/krea2-raw-fp8-scaled.safetensors` | ~13.1 GB |
| Krea 2 Turbo (inference testing) | [krea/Krea-2-Turbo](https://huggingface.co/krea/Krea-2-Turbo) | `models/diffusion_models/krea2-turbo-bf16.safetensors` | ~26.3 GB |
| Krea 2 Turbo **official fp8** (inference testing) | [Comfy-Org/Krea-2](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Krea-2) | `models/diffusion_models/krea2-turbo-fp8-scaled.safetensors` | ~13.1 GB |
| Krea 2 text encoder (bf16) | [Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct) | `models/text_encoders/Qwen_Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct/` | ~8.89 GB |
| Krea 2 text encoder **official fp8** | [Comfy-Org/Krea-2](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Krea-2) | `models/text_encoders/qwen3vl-4b-fp8/` | ~5.24 GB |

Krea 2 weights are governed by the [Krea 2 Community License](https://huggingface.co/krea/Krea-2-Raw/blob/main/LICENSE.pdf). Training and samples during training reuse Raw; Turbo is the inference-testing model (a LoRA trained on Raw loads directly on Turbo). The official fp8 builds roughly halve weight VRAM: fp8 Raw works directly as a training base model (the choice for 24 GB-class GPUs — see [training-tips → Krea 2 training](training-tips.md#krea-2-训练)), and the text encoder toggles between bf16 / fp8 via a radio in Settings. Krea 2 reuses Anima's existing VAE, so no duplicate VAE download is needed. When ModelScope is selected, Krea 2 files are downloaded from [Comfy-Org/Krea-2](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/Comfy-Org/Krea-2).

WD14 tagger models are not in this list — they are auto-downloaded from HF to `models/wd14/` on first use of the tagging step.

**Mirrors / slow connections**: switch the HuggingFace endpoint to a self-hosted mirror under Settings → Training → HuggingFace → endpoint, or switch the download source to ModelScope under Settings → Training → Download source (requires `pip install modelscope`).

Or via CLI (shares the same code as the UI; full flags in [tools/README.md](../../tools/README.md)):

```bash
python tools/download_models.py                   # Anima (default, official HF)
python tools/download_models.py --family krea2    # Krea 2 Raw + shared VAE + Qwen3-VL
python tools/download_models.py --family krea2 --variant turbo
python tools/download_models.py --endpoint URL    # Use self-hosted mirror
python tools/download_models.py --modelscope      # Use ModelScope
```

## Pipeline: follow the stepper

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8765/>, click "+ New project" on the projects page, and the sidebar stepper guides you through 8 steps (those marked ✱ are skippable):

1. **Download** — Booru search and file import sit side by side on desktop. Booru (configure Gelbooru / Danbooru credentials in Settings first) estimates matches before you confirm the batch size; file import accepts images / zip archives from the current device or an existing file selected with the app server picker, then asks you to confirm the import. The source-image area below shows the total image count and size.
2. **Curate** — unused images on the left and the current training folder on the right; select images to add them to that folder and manage training subfolders. When you need held-out evaluation images, switch the top **Destination** control to the secondary Validation mode.
3. **Preprocess** ✱ — overview (multi-select + one-click undo) + duplicate review + upscale (ESRGAN / Real-ESRGAN presets) + crop (manual boxes + aspect-ratio prefill) + retouch (paint over the source image or draw a training mask; [automatic head masks](auto-head-mask.en.md) can assist editing, but results must be saved manually). Skip if not needed.
4. **Tag** — choose WD14, CLTagger, or an OpenAI-compatible LLM (including a JoyCaption preset), then tune its thresholds; GPU execution providers fall back automatically. A trigger word entered at the top is injected into every caption. Existing captions are skipped by default; choosing overwrite requires an impact confirmation before the run starts. While idle, **This tagging plan** shows scope, policy, and estimated work. Once a task is live, its submitted snapshot is the **Current task**, while the form and summary become editable **Next-run settings**. **Current tagging status** separately shows training/validation coverage and facts from the previous run. Folder + skip displays “scan after start” because per-folder tagged counts are unavailable; an exact zero-image run remains allowed and completes as a successful worker no-op.
5. **Tag editor** — the active folder is the shared scope for bulk selection and tag distribution; the workspace supports bulk add / delete / replace, per-image correction, resizable three-pane editing, and restore points. External caption updates preserve local edits until you explicitly **Save and refresh** or **Discard and refresh**, and files the backend did not write remain pending.
6. **Regularization set** ✱ — **AI prior generation** is the default (the base model generates images with no LoRA), with faster **Booru reverse search** as an alternative. The run-plan summary appears once in the status rail; a full rebuild asks for confirmation before deleting existing images, captions, metadata, and deletion history. While a task runs, its immutable snapshot is shown separately from the editable **next-run settings**. After generation, filter images by folder, batch-delete outliers, or run automatic deduplication. mirror / flat structure, WD14 / CLTagger, and resolution clustering remain available.
7. **Train** — pick a preset to copy into the version's private config and edit parameters (autosaved with a 600ms debounce, no save button). Leaving the page, switching versions, submitting, or saving/applying/creating a preset waits for the latest draft to save; editing is temporarily disabled during these operations. If saving fails, the page retains your draft: retry saving in the local error notice, then repeat the intended action. Browser refresh/close still warns about unsaved changes. Presets are templates; later edits never modify the preset pool. The config toolbar groups the preset picker, Save as preset, and Simple / Advanced modes. The right-hand preview can collapse and remembers its state; data uses a narrower view and YAML a wider one. A separate summary shows only the base model, LoRA type, filename prefix, epochs, and estimated steps. The **Dataset stats / YAML preview** tabs show data composition and step derivation, or the full config. Step estimates are not runtime predictions. The page header keeps save status, **Schedule training**, and **Start Training**. Successful submission freezes the config and opens task detail; later draft edits do not affect the submitted task. While the version has an active task, you can edit the next-run draft but cannot submit again. **Model family** defaults to Anima; switching the dropdown to Krea 2 opens a confirmation dialog listing every weight path and family default about to be recomputed — confirm and the whole version trains as Krea 2 (see [training-tips → Krea 2 training](training-tips.md#krea-2-训练)).
8. **Test** — single-image / XY matrix / inference daemon.

View tasks on the **Queue** page; open **task detail** for logs / monitoring / output (with one-click full zip download).

The preprocessing overview's **Processed dataset / Deleted** views support arrow keys and Home/End; switching views clears the current selection. Images scroll independently so selection and undo controls stay visible. Select all in the processed view selects only processed images. Failed loads offer Retry; failed refreshes retain existing images instead of showing an empty dataset.

The Upscale page's resolution filter also supports arrow keys and Home/End and clears selection when changed. Choose Custom for a separate 256–4096-pixel input, or Off for direct 4× output. Folders with a resolution prefix continue to set the target resolution automatically.

## Test your LoRA + ComfyUI

After training, the sidebar **Test** page runs single-image / XY matrix / inference daemon for LoRA evaluation. Prompts can be pulled directly from the training set, eliminating round trips to ComfyUI. The LoRA catalog groups project checkpoints, Studio's default folder, and custom folders by project / source, with search plus source and project-version filters; manage extra folders under **Settings → Testing**. The attached XY editor keeps X / Y axes together, supports checkpoint and LoRA-strength axes, and lets you drag values into order. **Pick from gallery** in the Prompts section can also browse Danbooru or Gelbooru by source, multiple ratings, a time range, and tags. Tag search reuses the positive-prompt autocomplete and converts picked tags to Booru underscore form. Rating changes apply together when the menu closes, while the time range stays inside a button whose red dot indicates an active filter. Filters and the current page are remembered in the browser, and you can jump directly to a page number. Select one image and tag it with the globally configured WD14, CLTagger, or LLM; the result replaces the Training-set prompt. With **Auto-generate** enabled, a successful tag immediately starts generation with the new prompt. Configure the matching Booru credentials and tagger on the Settings page first. Studio rate-limits and caches proxied thumbnails by image ID, and does not import remote images into the training set.

When Settings → Testing → Save test images is enabled, newly saved single images and
XY cell PNGs include A1111 / Civitai-compatible metadata: the effective prompt,
sampling parameters, base model, VAE, LoRA weights, and resource SHA256 hashes. An
XY composite represents multiple parameter sets, so its full external metadata is
kept on the individual cell PNGs while the composite retains Studio's structured data.

The LoRA weights produced are already in `lora_unet_*` format and can be **dropped directly into ComfyUI** without any conversion.
