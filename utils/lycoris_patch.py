"""Patch LyCORIS LoKr rank-dropout masks onto the weight device.

Affected releases create the rank-dropout mask on CPU and multiply it into a
CUDA weight.  The compatibility wrapper delegates weight construction to the
installed LyCORIS implementation (preserving the v3 implementation or the v4
kernel dispatcher), then applies the same dropout semantics on the output
weight's device.

The patch is exact-version guarded.  Add a release only after reproducing the
bug against that artifact, and remove releases once their upstream
implementation is fixed.
