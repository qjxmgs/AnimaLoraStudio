# AnimaLoraStudio Design System

This document is the durable visual contract for Studio Web. Product behavior and
information architecture remain authoritative in the application and product docs;
this file defines how those behaviors are presented consistently.

## 1. Direction

AnimaLoraStudio is a focused creative workbench, not a marketing surface. Its visual
world is warm ivory, restrained orange, precise typography, and compact technical
controls. Light and dark themes express the same hierarchy. Changes should evolve
this world rather than replace it.

The interface serves two audiences at once:

- New users need clear hierarchy, familiar controls, and visible next actions.
- Experienced users need dense parameter editing, fast scanning, and stable layouts.

Consistency means equal semantics receive equal treatment. It does not mean every
surface has identical density.

## 2. Sources of truth

| Layer | Authority | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Foundation | `studio/web/src/styles/tokens.css` | Color, type, spacing, radius, shadow, motion, control states |
| Utility bridge | `studio/web/tailwind.config.js` | Maps CSS tokens into Tailwind utilities |
| Primitives | `studio/web/src/components/Button.tsx`, `Badge.tsx`, `Card.tsx`, `EmptyState.tsx`, `FormControl.tsx`, `Alert.tsx`, `ProgressBar.tsx` | Typed, accessible component APIs |
| Patterns | `PageHeader`, `StepShell`, `ActionGroup`, `SaveIndicator`, `SaveBar`, `ListToolbar`, `Dialog`, `Modal`, `Drawer`, `Tabs`, `SegmentedControl`, `Toast`, `Field` | Repeated page and interaction structures |
| Layout | `studio/web/src/components/AppShell.tsx`, `studio/web/src/styles/app-shell.css` | Viewport tracks, landmarks, and scroll ownership |
| Product surfaces | `studio/web/src/pages/` | Business state and composition, not new visual primitives |

A page may compose primitives with layout utilities. It must not recreate an
existing primitive with arbitrary colors, padding, font sizes, or hover states.

### Cross-surface UX decision protocol

Every product-surface UX proposal must resolve consistency before local
optimization, even when the request initially names only one page:

1. Read this document first and follow an existing semantic contract when one
   applies. Do not relocate a stable action, change feedback, or invent a new
   interaction because it looks locally cleaner.
2. If no contract applies, inspect representative current surfaces with the same
   user intent, object scope, risk, and task lifecycle. Repetition is evidence,
   not authority: distinguish an established pattern from migration debt and
   intentional specialist behavior.
3. When the same unresolved semantic decision recurs across surfaces, define the
   app-wide mental model here before implementing the page. State whether the
   current change completes the migration or is the first bounded adoption slice;
   do not let a one-page exception silently become a standard.
4. A surface may diverge only when its task semantics, object ownership, risk,
   lifecycle, or required professional geometry materially differ. Record that
   evidence and the anti-goals in its task brief.

A decision-ready UI/UX proposal must therefore answer three questions: what this
document already defines, how equivalent current surfaces behave, and whether the
chosen rule should apply across the app. If those answers are unknown, continue
the audit instead of entering implementation.

## 3. Foundations

### Color

Use semantic tokens instead of literal colors:

- `canvas` is the page field.
- `surface` is the normal content plane.
- `sunken` is for wells, navigation, and code/data regions.
- `elevated` is for overlays and popovers.
- `accent` identifies the primary action or active process.
- `ok`, `warn`, `err`, and `info` communicate state, never decoration alone.

Do not rely on color as the only state cue. Pair it with text, an icon, or an
indicator. Dark mode must preserve hierarchy rather than simply invert colors.

### Typography

The Studio uses the local system sans stack for interface copy and the local mono
stack for machine-readable data. Do not add a network font dependency: the app
must remain readable while offline and should not shift when a font finishes
loading. Use no more than `400`, `500`, and `600` for normal UI hierarchy.

| Role | Contract | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page title | `.type-page-title`: `text-2xl`, 600, primary | One `h1` for the current page or workflow step |
| Page description | `.type-page-description`: `text-md`, secondary, relaxed, max `68ch` | A concise explanation directly below the page title |
| Section title | `.type-section-title`: `text-lg`, 600, primary | A major region inside a page or dialog |
| Panel title | `.type-panel-title`: `text-sm`, 600, primary | A card, settings group, or compact panel |
| Section label | `.type-section-label`: `text-xs`, 600, tertiary, tracked uppercase | A direct category heading such as queue status; never an eyebrow above another heading |
| Field label | `.type-field-label`: `text-sm`, 500, secondary | The human-readable name of a form control |
| Field help | `.type-field-help`: `text-xs`, tertiary, relaxed | Optional supporting copy below a field |
| Metadata | `text-xs` + tertiary | Timestamps, counts, and passive context |
| Technical data | `font-mono`; add `.tnum` for comparable numbers | Code, paths, identifiers, logs, and measurements—not generic UI chrome |

Rules:

- Normal interface and body copy uses `text-base`; compact controls and secondary
  content use `text-sm`. `text-2xs` is reserved for dense supporting labels and
  must never carry a primary action or required instruction.
- Keep normal reading copy between `65ch` and `75ch`; headings and control labels
  remain content-sized rather than stretching across the viewport.
- Choose heading elements by document structure, then apply the matching role.
  Do not skip levels to obtain a visual size.
- Use sentence case for ordinary headings. Uppercase/tracking is reserved for a
  category label that stands on its own; it is not a decorative kicker.
- The configured density changes the scale without changing semantic roles.
- Arbitrary pixel font sizes require a documented layout constraint and should
  remain exceptional.

### Spacing, radius, and depth

Use the `--s-*`, `--r-*`, and `--sh-*` scales. New shared layouts use the
semantic Tailwind spacing aliases below instead of choosing a number by eye:

| Alias | Default | Relationship |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `related` | 8px | Icons, labels, and controls that form one action or datum |
| `field` | 12px | Parts of one field or compact component |
| `section` | 16px | Sibling groups within one region |
| `page-start` | 20px | Page-header leading inset |
| `page` | 24px | Page-shell inset and separation between ordinary regions |
| `page-loose` | 32px | Major region separation where a stronger pause is required |

The aliases resolve through `--space-*` to the density-aware `--s-*` scale.
Small `related` gaps stay stable; `field` and larger relationships contract or
expand with the selected density. Numeric spacing utilities remain a compatibility
path and migrate by component family. Do not globally remap them in a page PR.

Vertical rhythm follows content hierarchy: elements that form one control stay
closest, fields form a tighter group than sections, and sections form a tighter
group than page regions. A heading has more separation from the preceding region
than from the content it introduces. Shared page chrome uses semantic spacing so
its header, optional toolbar, and content keep aligned horizontal insets.

Within one hierarchy level, use one radius: controls use `--r-md`, ordinary cards
use `--r-lg`, and pills use `--r-pill`. Dense workbench panels may use `--r-md`
when their compactness is part of the information structure. Fixed or arbitrary
spacing is allowed only where it is geometry rather than rhythm—for example canvas
coordinates, image crops, table column sizing, or sticky offsets—and must remain
local to that specialized surface.

Shadows communicate elevation. Borders communicate grouping. Do not add shadows
merely to decorate every container.

### Density

- **Default** is the baseline for navigation, settings, dialogs, and ordinary forms.
- **Compact** is allowed for parameter-heavy workbenches, tables, and repeated row
  controls. It must use an explicit small component size or the global tight density,
  not local pixel values.
- **Loose** increases readability without changing component semantics.

## 4. Button contract

Use `Button` for button elements. Links that navigate may use `buttonClassName()`
when they need button presentation while retaining link semantics.

| Variant | Use | Do not use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `primary` | The single leading action in a local decision scope | Every positive action on a page |
| `secondary` | Normal actions and alternate choices | Passive navigation or icon-only chrome |
| `ghost` | Low-emphasis actions, toolbar controls, dismissals | Destructive actions without another cue |
| `warning` | Interrupting or canceling reversible/in-progress work | Permanent deletion |
| `danger` | Irreversible deletion or discarding recoverable state | Routine cancellation |

Sizes:

- `md`: ordinary forms and dialogs.
- `sm`: headers, cards, and compact action rows.
- `xs`: dense tables, filters, and micro toolbars; never body copy squeezed smaller.

Rules:

- Button labels name the action.
- Icon-only buttons require an accessible label.
- Loading buttons remain labeled, expose `aria-busy`, and cannot be activated.
- The imperative `useDialog()` API preserves the product's single-accent confirmation
  convention: its `tone` marks urgent dialog semantics but does not recolor the confirm
  button. Declarative destructive action groups continue to use `danger`.
- Toggle buttons expose `aria-pressed`.
- Disabled, hover, active, and keyboard-focus states come from the primitive.
- Do not combine `bg-*`, `border-*`, and `text-*` to reinvent an existing variant.

## 5. Badge contract

Badges are non-interactive labels. A clickable pill is a button or link, not a badge.

| Tone | Meaning | Common states |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `neutral` | Passive, queued, unknown, or canceled metadata | pending, scheduled, canceled |
| `accent` | Active work or the current process | running, training, evaluating |
| `success` | Successful completion or confirmed availability | done, completed, available |
| `warning` | Paused, partial, or attention required | paused, partial |
| `danger` | Failure or invalid state | failed, error |
| `info` | Informational classification without success/failure | source or category labels |

An active badge may include the shared pulsing indicator. Use `sm` only for dense
metadata such as announcement tags; status badges use the default size.

Domain components such as `VersionStatusBadge` own the mapping from backend state to
badge tone. The generic `Badge` component must not know API enums.

## 6. Surface and empty-state contract

Use `Card` for ordinary bordered content surfaces. The default card uses the ordinary
`--r-lg` radius; compact workbench panels opt into the compact radius explicitly.
Padding belongs to the component API when it describes the whole surface, so density
modes can adjust it through spacing tokens. Interactive links and buttons retain their
native semantics and use `cardClassName()` for card presentation.

Use `EmptyState` when a list or page region has no content to present:

- `md` is the primary zero state for an otherwise empty page or tab.
- `sm` is a compact no-match state inside an existing section.
- Use `embedded` inside an existing panel to retain the empty-state hierarchy without
  adding a nested Card surface; standalone states keep their default Card.
- Titles state what is absent; descriptions explain the next useful step.
- Actions are optional and must use the appropriate Button or link primitive.
- Loading, errors, and warnings are not empty states and require their own semantics.

A composite card with a primary open action and local actions must not nest buttons or
links. Use a semantic `Card` container, a sibling full-surface native link/button for
the primary action, and local `Button` controls above that hit area. Name the Card from
its visible title, name the primary action explicitly, and keep hidden local actions
non-pointer-interactive until hover or keyboard focus reveals them.

Do not reproduce `rounded-* + border-subtle + bg-surface` for an ordinary card or
hand-build centered zero-state typography on product pages.

## 7. Form-control contract

Use the typed `Input`, `Select`, `Textarea`, and `Checkbox` primitives for ordinary
native form controls. They preserve browser semantics while sharing focus, disabled,
invalid, sizing, and theme behavior. The legacy `.input` and `.input-mono` classes
remain compatibility paths during incremental migration.

The upscale operation panel adopts these controls at `sm` workbench size. Its
preset and conditional custom-edge input have separate labels and share the
computed target description via `aria-describedby`; never place two labelable
controls in one label. Header scope-wide and selected-image actions use
ActionGroup, with the selected-image primary action last. Model-missing guidance
uses a compact, non-live Alert; download and task payloads remain page-owned.
The image-resolution filter uses a named SegmentedControl (mutually exclusive
filter values, not content tabs). Keep an active bin visible even when a refresh
reduces its count to zero; do not silently change the selected filter. Folder
filtering and selection clearing stay page-owned. ImageGrid keeps its existing
bounded slot and internal list inset; the statistical sidebar owns its own scroll
when its cards exceed the available height.

Control sizes:

- `md` is the default for dialogs and ordinary forms and aligns with `Button md`.
- `sm` is for settings rows, filter toolbars, schema forms, and other explicitly
  compact workbench regions; it must not be recreated with local padding overrides.

Control surfaces communicate placement, not state:

- `surface` is the ordinary form plane and default.
- `canvas` is the compact Schema `Field` treatment inside a surrounding surface.
- `sunken` is for settings wells and data-entry regions designed as inset controls.

Use `mono` only for paths, identifiers, JSON, numeric technical values, and other
machine-readable content. Errors pair visible recovery copy with `invalid`, which
exposes `aria-invalid` and the shared error border/focus ring. Disabled appearance,
keyboard focus, placeholder color, and checkbox accent come from the primitive.
Do not replace a native select or checkbox with a custom interaction only to alter
its appearance.

The primitive owns presentation only. Debouncing, parsing, commit-on-blur, schema
validation, picker composition, and business state remain in Field or product
patterns. File/color/range inputs and composite pickers require their own contracts
and are not styled as text controls by default.

Settings explanations belong in the label-adjacent `InfoButton` tooltip according
to `docs/design/ui-info-design.md`; do not add permanent explanatory paragraphs
under individual settings.

## 8. Feedback contract

Use `Alert` for persistent, in-flow information, success confirmation, warnings, and
errors. `Toast` remains the transient notification pattern and reuses Alert's visual
tones without changing its timer or invocation API.

| Tone | Meaning | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `info` | Neutral operational context or guidance | non-blocking system information |
| `success` | A completed action that remains relevant in the current view | saved or imported confirmation |
| `warning` | Attention or recovery is required, but the state is not yet a failure | paused or held work |
| `danger` | An operation failed or content is invalid | failed loads and rejected operations |

Use `md` for ordinary page feedback and `sm` inside compact workbench regions. A
semantic icon accompanies each tone so meaning does not depend on color alone. Titles
are optional and should name the condition; body copy explains the consequence or
recovery. Actions belong in the dedicated action slot and use `Button`.

ARIA live behavior is explicit because not every visible notice is newly announced:
use `role="alert"` only for urgent dynamic failures, `role="status"` for non-urgent
dynamic confirmation, and no live role for persistent page context. Do not announce the
same event through both an in-flow Alert and a Toast; choose the surface nearest to the
recovery action. Field validation stays adjacent to its control; empty states, domain
status cards, and modal workflow steps are not Alerts. Error copy and recovery details
must wrap rather than truncate.

Do not recreate feedback with local `bg-*-soft + border-* + text-*` combinations.

## 9. Action-area and save-pattern contract

`ActionGroup` is the typed Pattern-layer entry point for related save, submit, and
recovery controls. Its slots render in a stable order: optional status first,
secondary or destructive actions next, and the single primary action last. The primary
action therefore stays at the far right in left-to-right layouts. A visual divider may
separate destructive or context-changing actions, but it does not create another
primary action.

Save and submit buttons are text-first. Do not prefix ordinary labels with floppy-disk,
checkmark, or other decorative emoji; reserve icons for established compact utilities,
and provide an accessible label for icon-only controls. Use `Button` loading and disabled
states rather than replacing the label with an unrelated spinner. An explicit save may
lose primary emphasis when nothing is dirty, but it remains in the primary slot so the
layout does not jump.

Placement follows editing scope:

- Use the page or step header for short, viewport-contained edits and quick actions.
  Workspace steps keep stable page-level task actions (including Train's Start and
  Schedule) in the header even when their inner parameter panels are long. Review
  content does not justify moving or duplicating these actions in a panel footer.
- Use a footer action area for long or scroll-heavy forms that require deliberate review
  before submit. Make it sticky only when the final action would otherwise be difficult
  to reach, and reserve content space so it never obscures fields.
- Keep actions that affect only one panel inside that panel; do not promote them to a
  page-level bar.
- Autosave surfaces show `SaveIndicator` status instead of a redundant Save button.
  If an error Toast already announces the same failure, disable the indicator's error
  announcement so assistive technology receives it only once.
  Train waits for the latest draft to save before SPA departure, version switching,
  submission, or preset creation/application/export. These boundaries temporarily
  disable draft editing; ordinary autosave and an active task do not. Failed saves
  keep the draft on the page with one local retry alert, without automatic retry
  loops or duplicate error Toasts. Retrying saves the draft; the user can then repeat
  the intended action. Browser refresh/close retains the unsaved-work warning.

Status copy precedes controls and uses a stable polite live region. At narrow widths,
action groups may wrap, but the primary action remains last and right-aligned. Snapshot
restore, reset, and destructive actions remain secondary to saving unless that recovery
operation is the sole purpose of the current scope.

## 10. Modal-dialog contract

`Modal` is the declarative Pattern-layer shell for interruptive tasks that require
protected focus: confirmations, short forms, option selection, and structured review.
Use the imperative `useDialog()` API for simple text-only alert, confirm, and prompt
flows; it renders through the same shell. Use a Drawer for persistent secondary work
that should remain available alongside page context, and do not put ordinary page
content in a modal merely to make it prominent.

Confirmation follows consequence, not control type. Require it when execution will
permanently delete persisted content, replace an existing persisted collection, discard
recoverable local edits, or abandon in-progress work that cannot resume. Confirm at the
execution boundary rather than when the user merely selects a dangerous mode, and name
the affected object and consequence. Do not confirm routine, reversible, or easily
undoable actions; warning copy beside the control is sufficient there.

Every modal has one required title, an optional concise description, optional header
utilities, one scrollable body, and an optional footer. Use `sm` for a short prompt, `md`
for ordinary forms, `lg` for structured comparisons or dense option sets, and `wide`
only for a genuine master-detail surface such as Announcement Center. The panel is
portalled above the app, keeps viewport-safe outer padding and a bounded height, and
leaves the title, header utilities, and footer visible while long body content scrolls.

Dismissal and focus are part of the Pattern rather than caller-owned behavior:

- Opening moves focus into the dialog; closing restores focus to the opener.
- Tab and Shift+Tab remain within the active dialog, and Escape dismisses unless an
  irreversible or in-progress operation explicitly disables it.
- A backdrop press may dismiss a reversible dialog. Pressing inside the panel, or
  starting an interaction inside and releasing outside, must not dismiss it.
- The shell supplies `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, and title/description linkage. Use
  `alertdialog` only when an immediate decision is required before work can continue.
- Lock background scrolling while open. Do not stack modal dialogs.
- Announcement Center is the representative `wide` master-detail modal. Its tag filter
  uses `SegmentedControl`; its announcement list is a labelled single-select listbox with
  wrapping vertical arrows plus Home/End; and the article region owns its own scroll.
  Announcement data, read-state persistence, update checks, and settings deep links remain
  feature-owned.

Footer actions use `ActionGroup`: status first, secondary or destructive actions next,
and the single primary action last. Keep validation near the relevant control; an error
Toast must not duplicate an error already announced inside the modal. Toast feedback remains
above the modal layer when an operation keeps the dialog open. Do not recreate modal
backdrops, panel geometry, focus listeners, or title linkage in feature code.

### Background model prerequisites and direct-edit task setup

Settings owns model acquisition and selection through the shared model-source
information architecture. Domains with selectable runtime models use the same
`SourceSelect`, `ModelSourceCard`, download/local registration, status, removal,
and fallback conventions. A task setup modal may select among currently installed
catalog rows, but it is not a second model manager: when nothing compatible is
installed, provide concise recovery guidance to Settings instead of embedding
download controls or logs. A failed enqueue clears busy immediately and provides
a local retry path.

Automatic head masking is the representative direct-edit adoption. Its low-emphasis
`Auto mask` ghost action matches Crop's optional prefill action and sits immediately
before Save all, with Save current remaining the primary last action. The shared Modal
is a short form containing
Recognition model, scope (all/current), confidence, padding and feather. It has no
explanatory subtitle, embedded model card, progress/review region, or Advanced
section; IoU remains an internal established default. Validation stays at each
field. The footer owns Cancel and Start; successful enqueue closes setup and
restores opener focus without interrupting the page-owned background job.

Completed non-stale detections become grouped unsaved edits on each affected
image's existing mask layer. Exact rectangular geometry and feathering render and
export through the same path as brush/eraser edits, coexist with loaded masks and
manual strokes, and contribute to existing dirty indicators. Each affected image
receives one undoable/redoable automatic operation; Save current and Save all are
the only persistence boundary. Successful no-head, failed, skipped, and stale
images remain clean. Open setup remains available when unsaved edits exist so the
Modal can explain the save prerequisite, but Start remains blocked. Completion copy
reports only applicable non-zero outcomes in plain user language; there is no proposal
selection, bounding-box overlay, persistent review/log panel, Apply, or protected Undo
in this UI; compatible legacy endpoints may remain.
Project/version/job identity guards async completion, and unsaved edits block a new
run. Only the matching preprocess stage can supply task state. After incorporation,
the editor switches to Training mask and brush mode so users can correct results.

## 11. Overlay-drawer contract

Use `Drawer` for an interruptive task that slides above the current workspace while
preserving visible context. It is an overlay side sheet, not a generic name for every
panel attached to an edge: bottom task logs remain page-owned footer panels, and Generate
pickers/editors remain attached workspaces with their own keep-alive geometry.

Drawer motion has one owner and one lifecycle: `closed → opening → open → closing`.
The shell remains mounted so cold and warm opens take the same path. Feature content must
not add a second entrance animation or independently decide when the panel becomes visible.
Static local content mounts in the same commit as the shell and moves with the panel; once
mounted, keep it alive across later opens. Do not insert a transient loading label or skeleton
for a page whose code and structure are already local—it creates flicker without communicating
real progress. Use a local skeleton only for genuinely asynchronous remote content with a
perceptible wait, and never replace the whole Drawer shell. Reduced-motion skips the authored
transition consistently.

Geometry and interaction belong to the Pattern:

- The panel is portalled above the AppShell and below Modal/Toast layers. Its width is always
  bounded by the viewport; long content scrolls inside the panel and never widens the page.
- The backdrop and panel animate as one authored moment. Closing is shorter than opening;
  loading, section changes, and lazy-module timing must not alter the shell motion.
- Opening focuses the panel or an explicit initial target. Tab remains inside, Escape and a
  direct backdrop press request a reversible close, and closing restores focus to the opener.
- While open, the application root is inert. Do not mutate `body` overflow for Studio drawers:
  the AppShell owns its own scroll container, and body scrollbar changes cause layout shift.
- A Modal opened from a Drawer is the active top layer. Escape closes the Modal first; the
  Drawer remains until its own close request succeeds.
- Deep links or `open({ section })` requests wait for `open` readiness, then scroll only the
  Drawer content owner. Never call early `scrollIntoView` in parallel with panel motion.

Settings is the first representative adoption. Its data and instant-save behavior remain
outside the Drawer Pattern; only shell timing, focus, dismissal, width, and internal scroll
readiness are shared.

## 12. Tabs and segmented-selection contract

Use `Tabs` for navigation among peer content panels and `SegmentedControl` for changing
one mutually exclusive value or working mode. They share visual rhythm and keyboard
behavior, but their semantics are not interchangeable: Tabs render `tablist` / `tab`
and reference labelled `tabpanel` content; segmented values render `radiogroup` /
`radio`. Do not use tab semantics for filters, view toggles, or actions that navigate to
a different route.

Tabs support two appearances without changing meaning:

- `underline` is the default for page-width or panel-level content sections. At narrow
  widths it scrolls horizontally instead of wrapping labels into ambiguous rows.
- `segmented` is for compact, bounded navigation inside a workbench panel. Use the same
  segmented appearance for mutually exclusive modes, but through `SegmentedControl`.
- Segmented tracks default to `layout="equal"` for existing fixed-width consumers.
  Toolbar filters and overview labels with differing lengths use `layout="content"`:
  intrinsic item widths, wrapping onto new rows when needed, and no label ellipsis.
  An exceptionally long label may wrap within its item. Preprocess resolution filters
  and Overview dataset tabs opt in; do not compensate with fixed widths or smaller text.

Selection follows focus for this application: Arrow keys move to the next enabled item
and activate it, wrapping at both ends; Home and End move to the first and last enabled
item. Exactly one enabled item participates in the page Tab order. Disabled options are
skipped. Every group has an accessible label, and every content tab supplies stable
`aria-controls` / `aria-labelledby` linkage. Do not recreate local active-state class
strings or implement feature-owned roving focus.

Use `sm` for dense nested controls such as X/Y axes and sidebar sections; use `md` for
primary panel navigation and mode choice. Compact selection labels may use `text-2xs`
because they are peer navigation, not a primary action or required instruction. Labels
may remain on one line in a segmented track only when the full label remains available
as the accessible name and title. Underlined tabs keep their intrinsic width and scroll
rather than truncating. Both appearances must preserve visible focus, disabled state,
theme contrast, density response, and Chinese/English label stability.

## 13. List-toolbar contract

Use `ListToolbar` for an ordinary list's collapsible search, facet-filter, and sort
region immediately below its page header. It is not the page action area, a bulk
mutation bar, or a professional workbench toolbar. `PageHeader` continues to own the
disclosure and refresh actions; Gallery autocomplete, draft filter popovers, Eval axis
selection, and tag bulk editing retain their domain-specific composition.

The Pattern owns a named region and stable slot order: dominant search first, filters
second, and sort last. This is also the DOM and keyboard order. At wide desktop widths,
the query owns the flexible primary track while compact facets remain trailing. At the
project's approved narrow-desktop breakpoint, the query takes a full first row and the
trailing controls wrap below it without changing order. Page-aligned padding, borders,
gaps, theme colors, and density response come from semantic tokens; callers must not
restore fixed percentage widths.

The disclosure button supplies `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`. Keep the current
region mounted with `hidden` while collapsed so the ID reference remains valid and the
row takes no layout space. Every region has a localized accessible name, and each input
or select retains its own label. The Pattern is presentational: query debounce,
persistence, active-filter dots, sorting, API parameters, paging resets, result counts,
refresh, clear behavior, and list mutations remain page-owned. Do not add unused result
or clear slots until a repeated product behavior has been established.

## 14. Async-state and progress contract

Async UI describes real work; it must not fabricate a waiting phase for local static
content. Use `Button` loading for one pending action, `ConfigSkeleton` for a genuine
initial remote schema/config fetch, and `ProgressBar` for an operation with duration.
A spinner or progress bar is not a substitute for the page's ordinary empty state.

A submitted task snapshot and an editable future draft are different interaction
scopes. Controls that still represent the active snapshot become read-only or disabled
for that operation scope. A surface may instead keep settings editable only when it
labels and visually separates them as the next-run draft; the active task remains
separately identifiable, and actions that would concurrently mutate the same destination
stay disabled. Independent panels may remain available. After reload, never present
fresh defaults as though they were the running task's submitted parameters. Existing
surfaces migrate to this contract by workflow slice; new work must not add an unlabeled
editable form beside a live task.

`ProgressBar` is the typed visual and accessibility primitive. Every instance has a
localized accessible label. Pass `value` and `max` only when the application has a
meaningful quantity; the primitive clamps it and exposes `aria-valuemin`,
`aria-valuemax`, and `aria-valuenow`. Omit `value` when work is real but its amount is
unknown—the indeterminate state must not display a fabricated `0%` or a pretend ETA.
`aria-valuetext` may add phase, batch, file, or step context. The primitive owns track,
fill, sizes, motion, and reduced-motion fallback; it never owns SSE, polling, upload
state, cancellation, retry, or business estimates.

Use `xs` for an edge-aligned workbench pipeline, `sm` for ordinary inline/background
work, and `md` for a blocking transfer dialog. Percentage text and byte/step metadata
use tabular mono numerals beside the bar rather than inside a narrow fill. Progress
color means active or complete work; errors move to `Alert`/Toast instead of leaving a
red bar that still claims to be progressing. Capacity, utilization, scores, and crop
ratios are data visualizations and do not use this async contract.

Announcements are event-based, not frame-based:

- Do not put rapidly changing percentages, bytes, or steps in a polite live region.
  The progressbar value remains available to assistive technology without announcing
  every tick.
- Announce a phase boundary such as processing, completion, or failure once through a
  stable atomic status/alert. Avoid duplicating the same event in inline feedback and
  a Toast.
- A blocking operation uses `Modal`; disable Escape/backdrop only while interruption
  would be unsafe. A background operation must not steal focus merely because progress
  updates.

A skeleton reserves the expected geometry of remote content and carries `aria-busy`.
Use it only while the initial remote structure is unavailable and the wait is
perceptible. Do not insert skeletons for local Settings/static pages, short state
transitions, refreshes where content can remain visible, or as an entrance animation.
Skeleton and indeterminate motion become a stable static indicator under
`prefers-reduced-motion`; meaning cannot depend on pulsing or travel.

## 15. App-shell and viewport contract

`AppShell` is the single desktop workspace frame. It owns the viewport, Sidebar
track, Topbar track, default main landmark, and the page-level scroll container.
Routes render inside its `main`; they must not recreate a second viewport-height
application shell. The Studio supports a wide desktop class above 1280px and a
compact desktop class at or below the shared 1280px breakpoint. This phase does
not define a mobile information architecture.

Geometry and scroll responsibility are fixed:

- The shell uses `100dvh` with a `100vh` fallback, `minmax(0, 1fr)` for the
  workspace track, and explicit `min-width: 0` / `min-height: 0` boundaries.
  `html`, `body`, and `#root` fill the viewport and do not become competing
  document scroll owners.
- The main landmark is the default page scroll owner and reserves a stable
  scrollbar gutter. A full-height workbench may add local panel scrolling only
  when its outer route still fits the main track; nested scroll regions must be
  deliberate and keyboard reachable.
- Sidebar width and Topbar height come from layout tokens. Sidebar branding and
  footer actions remain fixed while the named primary navigation region scrolls
  internally, so long project workflows never push collapse/settings actions
  outside the viewport. Current route links expose `aria-current`; theme uses the
  navigation-row recipe and collapse uses the shared `Button`. The project version row is a
  named control group: icon-only mutations use `Button`, while the switch trigger
  controls a named single-select listbox with initial focus, arrows, Home/End,
  Escape return, and explicit selected state.
- Topbar breadcrumb, active-task status, global notices, and search preserve that
  priority order. Active-task and queued-task status are native navigation links
  styled by the shared button recipe; notice and search triggers use icon-only
  `Button`s with dialog disclosure state. System resource pills expose bounded
  `meter` semantics and localized value descriptions rather than relying on color,
  width, or hover-only tooltips. At compact desktop widths, auxiliary system
  resource meters yield before navigation or actions; breadcrumb labels truncate
  visually while their full title and accessible name remain available.
- A visible-on-focus skip link targets the main landmark. Sidebar, breadcrumb,
  main, and overlay components retain native landmark/dialog semantics; route
  changes do not steal focus automatically.
- Modal, Drawer, Toast, command surfaces, and image preview remain portalled
  overlay layers and never consume AppShell grid space. The anchored command
  palette is a modal command surface: its named combobox controls a listbox,
  keeps DOM focus in the query field, exposes the active option through
  `aria-activedescendant`, supports wrapping arrows plus Home/End, traps Tab,
  and restores the invoking search control after Escape or backdrop close.
  Drawers may inert the app root; overlays must not alter shell width or
  introduce a second body scrollbar.

App-shell responsiveness belongs to `styles/responsive.css` and uses the shared
1280px breakpoint. Route-specific workbench restructuring is a later Layout
adoption concern, not permission to hide primary actions or add arbitrary
component-local breakpoints.

## 16. Page and workflow shell contract

Routes use one of three explicit compositions; do not introduce a universal shell
that hides scroll ownership.

A **document page** follows `PageHeader` → optional full-bleed toolbar/subnav →
page-inset body. `AppShell` main remains its only vertical scroll owner. Document
routes must not add `h-full`, `overflow-hidden`, or a second page-level
`overflow-y-auto`. The header may be sticky because it shares the main scroller.
Projects is the representative ordinary list-page contract.

A **bounded list page** is reserved for high-frequency lists whose persistent
controls must remain visible while many items scroll. Its route fills the AppShell
main track and composes `PageHeader` → optional full-bleed toolbar → named,
keyboard-focusable list scrollport → persistent footer. Header, toolbar, and footer
are siblings outside the scrollport; the route marks AppShell scrolling as contained
so the outer stable scrollbar gutter is released, and content inset belongs to an
inner wrapper so the active browser scrollbar reaches the route edge. Queue is the
representative contract. Do not use `StepShell` for this composition or add nested
scrolling inside list rows.

A **workspace step** uses `StepShell`. It fills the route track, keeps page scrolling
locked, and delegates scrolling to explicit inner panels. Its order is `PageHeader`
→ optional `belowHeader` → workspace content → optional `TaskLogDrawer` footer.
The workspace header is not sticky because the shell itself does not scroll.
`belowHeader` is full bleed and owns its own padding. Content defaults to the shared
page inset; specialized canvas geometry may choose `inset="none"` only when the
caller also owns its boundaries and keyboard-reachable scroll regions.

`StepShell` is not a workflow-state machine: it does not receive step indexes,
change routes, save data, or own business status. `SaveBar` remains a header action,
not an invented sticky footer. Settings Drawer, Generate, Gallery, evaluation
matrices, and image editors retain their documented specialized scroll geometry.

## 17. Responsive-layout contract

The responsive layer distinguishes **wide desktop** (`> 1280px`) from
**compact desktop** (`<= 1280px`). It adapts content hierarchy inside the
AppShell; it does not invent a mobile navigation model. Shared responsive rules
live in `styles/responsive.css`, while business state and DOM order remain owned
by the page.

Ordinary pages follow these rules:

- Page headers keep title, helper navigation, and primary actions visible. At
  compact desktop, the action slot may take a full row and `topRight` helpers
  rejoin normal flow instead of overlapping title or actions.
- Auto-fill card grids use a container-safe minimum such as
  `minmax(min(100%, <preferred-width>), 1fr)`, so the grid never forces the main
  track wider than the available content area.
- Dense list rows preserve identity, type/state, live progress, and actions.
  Auxiliary timestamps or duplicated metadata yield first at compact desktop;
  hidden visual metadata must remain available in the row's accessible name,
  title, or detail route.
- Summary cards may reduce column count. Action rows wrap without changing DOM
  order. A genuinely tabular fixed-width region establishes its own labelled,
  keyboard-focusable horizontal scroll boundary instead of overflowing the page.
- Truncation is limited to secondary labels and long paths, with the full value
  available through `title` or an equivalent disclosure. Density and translated
  copy must not remove controls or alter action priority.

Professional split workspaces (Generate canvas, media curation, evaluation
matrices, image editors, and similar surfaces) preserve their task-specific
geometry and explicit local scroll owners. They must not inherit ordinary-page
stacking mechanically. Any later restructuring requires a representative pilot
and content-driven evidence; `md`/`lg`/`xl` utility classes are not an independent
breakpoint policy.

## 18. Split-workspace and pane-geometry contract

Preprocess Overview follows the same virtual-grid boundary as Curation: the
`ImageGrid` wrapper directly fills a `flex-1 min-h-0` panel slot; content inset is
passed through `contentClassName` to the Virtuoso list. Do not add an outer
`overflow-y-auto` wrapper or compensate with negative margins. The panel header
and batch actions remain outside the grid scrollport. Loading, load failure and
empty content are distinct; a failed refresh retains already loaded images.

Download is the representative acquisition workspace. Booru search and file
import are always-open sibling cards on desktop and stack only at compact widths;
do not add a mode-tab row or a disclosure above the source grid. Booru preserves
the deliberate `estimate → confirm count → start` sequence. Before the first
estimate, the plan row shows one quiet “not queried” status and withholds the
count field instead of repeating unknown placeholders or explanatory empty-state
copy. After an estimate, show the match total once, the editable batch count once,
and a plain start action; do not repeat the same count in shortcuts or button copy.
Only when the backend applies exclusions may a compact inline indicator expose the
effective query through its tooltip/accessibility text. File import distinguishes
browser transfer from a server-accessible path, but both sources share
`select → review selection → import`; the selection summary stays on one truncated
line with full names/paths in its tooltip, and selecting a server path never imports
immediately. Passive image count and total size belong in the
source-image header. Do not restore a permanent statistics rail or
format-distribution chart at the expense of the ImageGrid. The source grid remains
the only image scroll owner, permanent deletion keeps confirmation, and a failed
refresh retains loaded images with an in-place retry.

Train preserves a collapsible side preview: the draft/data view is approximately
3:1, while YAML receives approximately 3:2 for readable code. The divider handle
remains reachable when closed; open/closed state and selected tab are persisted,
and collapsing returns the preview's space to the draft. This is an attached
workspace, not an overlay Drawer. Start and Schedule stay in the StepShell header
alongside one SaveIndicator, never in a duplicate bottom bar. The preset trigger is
content-sized with a safe maximum, not flex-grown across the row. Preset actions
stay left while the visibly labelled Parameter display mode occupies the toolbar's
far-right column directly above the section-index rail. At compact widths, when the
index is hidden, the mode remains against the toolbar's right edge.
The preview uses compact right-anchored peer Dataset stats / YAML Tabs. An isolated
summary div shows only the configured base-model filename/display name, LoRA type,
filename prefix, epochs, and estimated total steps. Labels stay near left-aligned
values. Do not substitute the family's global default for the configured model or
repeat rank, precision and optimizer fields. Dataset stats owns samples, batch/GA
or NaViT pack derivation, step-cap explanation and size distribution. It retains
the full `steps/epoch × epochs → natural total → max_steps-capped total` derivation
even though the final estimate also appears in the identity summary, because the
data view must explain how that number was obtained. No generic Ready badge implies
preflight validation. Active tasks remain distinguishable from the next-run draft;
a task-details entry stays visible in the header when its preview is collapsed.
Compact desktop stacks the attached preview under one workspace scroller and
retains the collapse control; YAML keeps a bounded code scrollport.

Tagging and Regularization share one async-planner layout contract. At wide desktop,
the editable setup column and the status rail use a consistent `3fr / 2fr` ratio;
at compact desktop they stack under one workspace scroll owner. Idle state names the
editable summary as this run's plan. While a job is live, the submitted parameters
are an immutable Current task and the still-editable form/summary are explicitly
Next-run settings; conflicting Start, clear, delete, and dedup actions remain disabled.
The PageHeader owns only stable task actions and does not duplicate the plan summary.

Tagging keeps the four run decisions (tagger, scope, existing-caption policy, trigger
word) together and exposes only the active tagger's parameters. Existing captions
default to `skip`; choosing overwrite must warn in the run-plan summary and require
confirmation when the selected scope is known or may contain captions. Data status
owns train/validation coverage and facts recoverable from the last job ledger; never
present today's global model or preset as the previous run's exact configuration.
Exact zero-work runs remain valid worker no-ops. Because the API has no per-folder
tagged count, folder + skip displays “scan after start” rather than a false exact
estimate. Start exposes labelled busy state, and Advanced is a named disclosure with
`aria-expanded` / `aria-controls`.

Regularization is a two-stage generation workspace. `Generate` and `Images` use the
shared underline Tabs immediately below the PageHeader; this stable full-width divider
separates page-level stages from controls inside either stage. AI prior remains the
default source and Booru remains the faster alternative. Their local source picker uses
content-sized pill radios with no full-column background track, preserving the existing
source hierarchy and keeping the explanatory copy below the choice. The Images-stage
folder filter likewise uses independent compact filter chips; the chips may wrap, but no
shared background stretches through the remaining toolbar space. The generate stage
separates the run plan from persisted reg-set facts.
Full rebuild requires a confirmation that names the images, captions, metadata, and
deletion history being removed. Initial load failure, stale refresh failure,
unavailable train-tag statistics, and a truly empty reg set remain distinct states
with local retry paths. The Images stage owns folder filtering and batch actions above
a single `ImageGrid` scroll owner.

Preprocess tool navigation remains native route Links (including the current
route), with a named nav and `aria-current="page"`. It reuses the underline
selection recipe and its local horizontal overflow/focus treatment, not tablist
semantics. Only the Overview's local dataset views use Tabs and a stable shared
panel with `aria-labelledby` pointing to the selected tab.


A split workspace preserves simultaneous context for a task; it is not an ordinary
responsive grid and there is no universal split-shell component. `PaneResizer` is
the shared interaction primitive only for authored, user-resizable horizontal
separators. The parent remains authoritative for pane DOM order, percentage state,
persistence, compact behavior, and local scroll owners.

Pane geometry follows these rules:

- Persisted percentages are untrusted input. The same bounded effective value must
  drive pane geometry, separator ARIA, pointer drag, and keyboard changes. Invalid
  two-fixed-pane state is repaired against one shared width budget so a flexible
  middle pane retains its declared minimum.
- A separator names its controlled pane with `aria-controls`, exposes min/current/max
  percentage values, supports Left/Right plus Home/End, and restores body cursor and
  text-selection styles after pointer up, cancellation, capture loss, or unmount.
- Every bounded flex pane and every link in its height chain uses `min-width: 0` /
  `min-height: 0`. Exactly one descendant owns overflow for each axis. Virtualized
  media grids remain direct bounded children of their pane; visual inset belongs to
  the virtual list content, never to a wrapper that breaks measured height or moves
  the browser scrollbar inward.
- Curation is the representative responsive two-pane workspace: at compact desktop
  it stacks panes and removes the inactive separator; at wide desktop the fixed pane
  uses the bounded persisted percentage. Tag Edit is the representative authored
  three-pane workspace: the two fixed panes share one budget and reserve the middle
  preview minimum even when stored values are stale or corrupt. If the three authored
  panes no longer fit, its named workspace establishes one keyboard-focusable
  horizontal boundary rather than shrinking tools below useful widths or clipping them.
  In Tag Edit, the active folder is also the authoritative selection/statistics scope:
  changing it clears selection and the old single-image context. External caption
  updates may refresh a clean cache, but must preserve dirty edits behind explicit
  save-and-refresh or discard-and-refresh actions. Commit responses are authoritative;
  skipped files remain dirty instead of being reported as saved. Text-mode edits enter
  the local cache immediately—there is no separate sync action—and only the page-level
  Save control persists them. While any caption is dirty, that control uses the danger
  emphasis; each affected thumbnail and the active tag-editor header carry an explicit
  unsaved marker so dataset and image scope remain distinguishable.
- Train preview, Tagging status, Generate canvas and attached drawers, preprocessing
  editors, and evaluation matrices retain their specialist topology. Do not add
  resize handles or migrate them to `PaneResizer` without task-specific evidence.

## 19. Accessibility and resilience

Every primitive must work with keyboard focus, disabled state, light/dark themes,
all three density modes, and both Chinese and English labels. Focus is always visible.
Controls must tolerate longer English copy without fixed-width truncation unless the
full value is available through an established disclosure pattern.

Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; status information must remain understandable when
animation is disabled.

## 20. Migration policy

Migration is incremental:

1. Preserve the CSS classes as compatibility primitives.
2. Use typed components for new work.
3. Migrate representative surfaces with tests.
4. Move remaining pages by component family, not by arbitrary page batches.
5. Remove old compatibility paths only after repository-wide adoption.

A migration must preserve business behavior, route contracts, schema, SSE events,
and localization unless those changes are explicitly part of its scope.
